Cold heart moved in,
And the rain came down.
That's the way the weather's been,
Since she come around.
No the sun don't shine,
'Round here much anytime.
Old cabin fever,
Make you lose your mind.

Cause she's gone out again,
With her fair weather friends.
This thing is turnin' to pain,
This storm will put out the flame.

I like it when it's stormy,
Cause it reminds me of my life.
When lightning strikes without warning,
Like it has in my world once or twice.
I hear the thunder rolling,
Feel the icy, cold, hail storms.
I like it when it's stormy,
But I don't like bein' alone.

I like it when its stormy,
Blowin' a hard rain.
Lookin' out my window,
Wishin' you was comin' back again.
Oh the things that we do,
On a day like this,
I'm gonna find me somebody new,
That likes to hear the thunder,
Feel the icy, cold, hail storms.
I like it when it's stormy,
But I don't like bein' alone.
