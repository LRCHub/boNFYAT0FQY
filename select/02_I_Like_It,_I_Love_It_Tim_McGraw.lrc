[00:24.16] Spent 48 dollars last night at the county fair
[00:32.35] I throwed out my shoulder, but I won her that teddy bear
[00:39.46] She's got me sayin' "Sugar Pie", "Honey", "Darlin'", and "Dear"
[00:43.82] I ain't seen the Braves play a game all year
[00:47.99] I'm gonna get fired if I don't get some sleep
[00:51.63] My long lost buddies say I'm getting in too deep
[01:15.63] 
[00:55.25] But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
[00:59.34] I try so hard, I can't rise above it
[01:03.38] Don't know what it is 'bout that little girl's lovin'
[01:06.93] But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
[01:30.93] 
[01:26.42] My mama and daddy tried to teach me courtesy
[01:33.84] But it never sank in 'til that girl got a hold of me
[01:41.60] Now I'm holdin' umbrellas, and opening up doors
[01:45.88] I'm taking out the trash and I'm sweeping my floor
[01:49.77] I'm crossing my fingers, and counting every kiss
[01:53.72] Prayin' that it keeps goin' on like this
[02:13.72] 
[01:57.23] 'Cause I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
[02:01.22] I try so hard, I can't rise above it
[02:05.21] I don't know what it is 'bout that little girl's lovin'
[02:08.79] But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
[02:32.79] 
[02:12.51] Gotta wash my truck and dress up
[02:16.73] To pick her up to watch TV
[02:20.38] When she sits down on the sofa, she'll move a little closer
[02:24.45] She can't get enough of me
[02:37.45] 
[02:28.22] And I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
[02:32.22] I try so hard, I can't rise above it
[02:36.18] I don't know what it is 'bout that little girl's lovin'
[02:39.69] But I like it, I love it, I want some more of it
[03:03.69] 
[02:47.30] Come on, baby
[02:49.03] You know what I like
[02:53.36] Yeah, I like that
[03:01.86] 
[03:08.16] Hey, don't forget to turn out the lights
