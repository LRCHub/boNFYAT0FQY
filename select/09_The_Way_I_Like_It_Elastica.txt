When I work all day
Just the way I like it
Sing a song with a subtle hand
When I need to spike it
And I'm living all right
And I'm doing ok
Had a lover who was made of sand
And the wind blew him away

But I've got a good idea.

Don't need to be right
Don't need to be wrong
Been torn with a subtle hand
That's why I sing this song
It's a rolling ride, oh yeah
That look in your eyes, oh no
Hold me with another hand
It'll be all right
